A deep learning-powered application designed to detect AI-generated synthetic facial images, commonly known as deepfakes. This project combines a lightweight convolutional neural network with an interactive web application to provide real-time, interpretable deepfake classification.

## Dataset: Deepfake & Real Images (Kaggle):

## Project Overview

This project addresses the increasing threat of deepfakes in digital media by providing a deep learning-based solution to verify the authenticity of facial images. It utilizes a customized version of the **MobileNetV2** architecture and is deployed through a user-facing **Streamlit** web application. The system enables users to upload an image and receive an immediate prediction of whether the image is real or synthetically generated.

---

## Model Architecture

The core model is built upon **MobileNetV2**, a lightweight CNN architecture optimized for mobile and low-power devices. The **feature extraction layers were frozen**, preserving their pre-trained weights, while the classification head was replaced with a custom sequence of layers to suit binary classification tasks.

### Customization Includes:
- Retained MobileNetV2 feature extractor
- Added `MaxPooling2D` and dense layers for dimensionality reduction
- Final activation layer replaced with a **sigmoid function** to produce probabilistic binary output:

σ(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
​

### Training Specifications:
- Loss Function: `Binary Crossentropy`
- Optimizer: `Adam`
- Image Input Size: `224 x 224`
- Output: Probability score ∈ [0, 1]  
- Regularization: `EarlyStopping`, `ModelCheckpoint`

---

## Dataset

The model was trained on the **Celeb-DF v2** dataset and supplemented with synthetically generated and augmented samples. Preprocessing involved normalization, resizing, and labeling images into real or deepfake categories.

---

## Performance

- Validation Accuracy: **>90%**
- Inference Time: **~1.5 seconds per image**
- Output: **“Real”** or **“Deepfake”** with confidence score

---

## Web Application (Streamlit)

An interactive and minimalistic web interface allows users to test the model in real time. Built with **Streamlit**, the application delivers fast predictions and comprehensive visual feedback.

### Core Features
-  Upload facial images (JPG, JPEG, PNG)
-  Instant prediction with label and confidence
-  Auto-generated downloadable PDF report
-  Sidebar explanation of deepfakes
-  Theme toggle: Light / Dark
-  Recent prediction history with thumbnails
